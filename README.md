<!-- PROJECT INFORMATION -->
## Introduction
My personal portfolio is a repository housing a comprehensive collection of my past and ongoing projects. The core objective of this website revolves around attracting hiring managers and potential employers, while minimizing as much "dead time" as possible. This is achieved by presenting all vital information about myself and my projects at a single glance. The portfolio is designed in a way such that viewers can readily access all important details. In cases where a viewer wishes to learn more, further navigation is provided.
